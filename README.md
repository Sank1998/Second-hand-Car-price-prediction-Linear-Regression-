# Second-hand-Car-price-prediction-Linear-Regression-
A study on the second-hand automobile market in the UK for a particular model and  make, to identifying the most significant factors in determining a used car's pricing. A statistical model is developed to forecast a car's market value solely based on its  mileage, engine size, and other optional extra factors that affect the car's selling price.

Objectives of the report:
We conduct a study on the second-hand automobile market in the UK for a particular model and 
make, on behalf of a market research business working for Car4all. We assist the marketing 
research agency in identifying the most significant factors in determining a used car's pricing. 
We further develop a statistical model to forecast a car's market value solely based on its 
mileage, engine size, and other optional extra factors that affect the car's selling price.

Executive Summary:
The report summarizes the study conducted on the secondhand car market in Stanmore
(UK),for a market research company. Selling Prices of the car is predicted based on the 
different independent variables. For the analysis data was collected and cleaned from a used 
cars selling website. A sample was derived from the population and further analysis was 
proceeded. Sample was visualized for understanding the data and then data was tested to 
check whether the sample can produce a population parameter. Finally, regression was 
implemented to predict the selling price and residual analysis was carried to comment on the 
adequacy of the model. The selling price calculator is put down in the last part of the analysis.

Source and Description:
The research examines the costs of used Volkswagen Passat vehicles in Stanmore. "www.autotrader.co.uk", a respected and specialized website, was used to collect the necessary data. The Volkswagen Passat's selling price, miles-driven, body design, 
Transmission type, and fuel type are all the elements investigated further. 300+ different data 
values were scraped from the website and a sample of 118 rows was chosen for further study.

Challenges: 
The data was acquired via the internet, and then it was wrangled to deal with 
unstructured data. Our observations suggested that values were missing at random, which led 
us to conclude that the data sample was still representative of the population. For further 
analysis, missing values were eliminated from the dataset.

Sampling Method and Data representativeness: 
A simple random sampling method is used 
to extract the samples from the population. A simple random sample is a subset of a statistical 
population with an equal chance of being chosen. A simple random sample reflects a group in 
an unbiased way. Because every member of the population has an equal probability of being 
chosen, it is a fair technique to pick a sample from the population dataset. As a result, we can 
say that our sample is representative of the population dataset.

Consideration of 5-year range of registration for the cars:
When we look at cars manufactured more than five years ago, the selling price is significantly 
lower than a car that was just registered or manufactured (also affected by other factors). 
Including these kinds of data, outliers would arise in the analysis resulting in skewed or biased 
results. By deleting or not considering these sorts of numbers and developing the most 
parsimonious model possible, we hope to reduce the impact of outliers.
